# NOVEL IDEAS:

  -- As writers, what do we do when inspiration strikes and we happen to be at the grocery store, a bar, the beach, or wherever?  We reach for the nearest napkin or piece of scrap paper, grab a marker or dried out pen, and try to scribble out the essence of that inspiration.  Or, worse still, we tell ourselves that we will remember this latest great idea.  No more!  Novel Ideas provides a hub for us to quickly record our thoughts and ensure that we won't have to rely on illegible napkin scribblings or our faulty memories again.
